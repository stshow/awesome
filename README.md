Awesome WM configs

Based on: https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats

#### Default Programs used: 

1. Simple Terminal (https://st.suckless.org/)
2. xfce4-power-manager
3. nm-applet (Network Manager applet)
4. pasystray
5. parcellite
6. unclutter

#### To do: 

-Integrate https://github.com/RobSis/treesome/ for i3-like splitting of windows. 
-Integrate scratchpad-like behavior for chats. https://github.com/lcpz/lain/blob/master/util/quake.lua works well with telegram and this behavior can be duplicated by copying `quake.lua` to `<app-name>.lua` and then replacing the word "quake" with "app-name". 
-Lain `quake.lua` does NOT work well with Slack. Need to investigate alternatives there. This could be that alternative: https://github.com/notnew/awesome-scratch, but not sure just yet.
